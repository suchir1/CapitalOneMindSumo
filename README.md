# CapitalOneMindSumo
This repository contains the code I used to create the website for the Capital One MindSumo challenge on San Francisco emergency call data. All of the DelayGrapher python files are redundant so looking at one essentially covers looking at them all, it was simply convenient to have them separate rather than together.

The DispatchPredictor python file contains the code I used to generate an array of the most likely dispatch for any user-inputted address/time combination.

The HeatmapCreator python file was used to create the frequency, urgent, and non-urgent heatmaps of emergency calls.

Finally the District7Counter python file was used to figure out what types of calls District 7 received in the most to explain why District 7's response times were the longest.
